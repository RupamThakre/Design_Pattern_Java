# Design Patterns in Java

üß© 1. Creational Patterns - Focus on object creation mechanisms.

1. Singleton ‚Äì Ensures a class has only one instance.
2. Factory Method ‚Äì Creates objects without specifying exact class.
3. Abstract Factory ‚Äì Produces families of related objects.
4. Builder ‚Äì Constructs complex objects step by step.
5. Prototype ‚Äì Clones existing objects.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Structural Patterns - Focus on how classes and objects are composed.

1. Adapter ‚Äì Converts one interface to another.
2. Bridge ‚Äì Separates abstraction from implementation.
3. Composite ‚Äì Treats individual and groups of objects uniformly.
4. Decorator ‚Äì Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
5. Facade ‚Äì Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
6. Flyweight ‚Äì Shares common parts of object state to reduce memory.
Proxy ‚Äì Provides a placeholder for another object.

üîÑ 3. Behavioral Patterns - Focus on communication between objects.

1. Observer ‚Äì Notifies dependent objects when state changes.
2. Strategy ‚Äì Defines a family of algorithms, interchangeable.
3. Command ‚Äì Encapsulates a request as an object.
4. State ‚Äì Allows an object to alter behavior based on state.
5. Template Method ‚Äì Defines a skeleton of an algorithm in a method.
6. Mediator ‚Äì Reduces communication complexity between objects.
7. Chain of Responsibility ‚Äì Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
8. Iterator ‚Äì Provides a way to access elements sequentially.
9. Memento ‚Äì Saves and restores the previous state of an object.
10. Visitor ‚Äì Separates an algorithm from an object structure.


# **1. Singleton Design Pattern**

A singleton is object creational pattern that allows our application to create one and only one instance of 
a particular class, no matter how many times that class is used in our application.

- Ex. PropertyReader - read the properties from file and it is used multiple times in our application

**Intent of Singleton Pattern :**

- To restrict the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
- Useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system (e.g., Configuration settings, Logger, Cache, etc.).

# **2. Factory Design Pattern**

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern. It provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

Instead of calling a constructor directly to create an object, you use a factory method that returns an instance of a class.

**üß† Why Use It?**

- You want to decouple object creation from the client code.
- You want to return different types of objects based on input.
- Adding new types doesn't require changes in client code.

Follows the Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).

**üß± Basic Structure**
````java

// 1. Product interface
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

// 2. Concrete Products
public class Circle implements Shape {
 public void draw() {
     System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
 }
}

public class Square implements Shape {
 public void draw() {
     System.out.println("Drawing a Square");
 }
}

// 3. Factory Class
public class ShapeFactory {
  public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
    if (shapeType == null) return null;
    if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) return new Circle();
    else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) return new Square();
    return null;
}
}

// 4. Client Code
public class FactoryPatternDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
ShapeFactory factory = new ShapeFactory();

        Shape shape1 = factory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        shape1.draw();

        Shape shape2 = factory.getShape("SQUARE");
        shape2.draw();
    }
}

**Advantages**

- Loose coupling between client code and object creation logic.
- Easy to introduce new types without changing client code.
- Centralized object creation logic.

**Disadvantages**
- Can introduce too many classes.
- May become harder to maintain if not managed properly.
