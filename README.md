Design patterns in Java

# **1. Singleton Design Pattern**

A singleton is object creational pattern that allows our application to create one and only one instance of 
a particular class, no matter how many times that class is used in our application.

- Ex. PropertyReader - read the properties from file and it is used multiple times in our application

**Intent of Singleton Pattern :**

- To restrict the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance.
- Useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system (e.g., Configuration settings, Logger, Cache, etc.).

# **2. Factory Design Pattern**

The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern. It provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created.

Instead of calling a constructor directly to create an object, you use a factory method that returns an instance of a class.

**ðŸ§  Why Use It?**

- You want to decouple object creation from the client code.
- You want to return different types of objects based on input.
- Adding new types doesn't require changes in client code.

Follows the Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).

**ðŸ§± Basic Structure**
````java

// 1. Product interface
public interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

// 2. Concrete Products
public class Circle implements Shape {
 public void draw() {
     System.out.println("Drawing a Circle");
 }
}

public class Square implements Shape {
 public void draw() {
     System.out.println("Drawing a Square");
 }
}

// 3. Factory Class
public class ShapeFactory {
  public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
    if (shapeType == null) return null;
    if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) return new Circle();
    else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) return new Square();
    return null;
}
}

// 4. Client Code
public class FactoryPatternDemo {
public static void main(String[] args) {
ShapeFactory factory = new ShapeFactory();

        Shape shape1 = factory.getShape("CIRCLE");
        shape1.draw();

        Shape shape2 = factory.getShape("SQUARE");
        shape2.draw();
    }
}

**Advantages**

- Loose coupling between client code and object creation logic.
- Easy to introduce new types without changing client code.
- Centralized object creation logic.

**Disadvantages**
- Can introduce too many classes.
- May become harder to maintain if not managed properly.
